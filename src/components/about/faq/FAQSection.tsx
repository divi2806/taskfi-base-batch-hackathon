                TASK-fi is a gamified productivity platform that rewards users with $TASK tokens for completing tasks that benefit them, such as solving LeetCode problems or watching educational content. We're combining learning with blockchain technology to create verifiable achievements and real rewards.

              <AccordionContent className="px-6 pt-0 pb-4 text-gray-300">
                We use two verification methods: (1) API integrations with platforms like LeetCode to automatically verify completion, and (2) a community-based verification system where users can earn karma and tokens by verifying other users' tasks. We're also developing AI-based verification for image, PDF, and text proof submissions.

                The AI Agent Marketplace is a platform where users can buy task-specific AI agents to enhance productivity. Developers can contribute their agents and earn 97.5% of the payment in $TASK tokens, with 2.5% going to platform fees. It's similar to Hugging Face but with a focus on productivity and financial incentives.

                DAO governance gives users ownership and voting rights in the platform. It allows community members to propose and vote on changes, ensures transparency through blockchain verification, and creates a sense of ownership that drives engagement. Think of it like investing early in Duolingo, but with community governance and direct token benefits instead of ads.
